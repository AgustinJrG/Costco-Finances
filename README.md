Costco Wholesale Corporation is a leading global retailer known for its membership-based warehouse club model, which offers a broad range of high-quality products at competitive prices. The company provides goods across various categories, including groceries, electronics, clothing, and home goods, among others. Costco’s emphasis on bulk purchasing and value-oriented pricing has fostered a loyal customer base, driving consistent revenue growth and operational efficiency. The company’s robust business model, combined with its ability to leverage economies of scale, has solidified its position as one of the largest and most successful retailers worldwide. Over the past decade, Costco has demonstrated resilience and adaptability in an ever-evolving retail environment, as evidenced by its expanding footprint and sustained net income growth.

Despite the rapid expansion of locations, Costco’s financial stability has remained strong. The company's debt-to-equity ratio has consistently adhered to industry standards, and it has shown year-over-year growth in net profit margin, which demonstrates its ongoing financial health. Notably, Costco’s inventory turnover has decreased by just two days over the last ten years, with the current turnover rate standing at 30 days. This indicates that Costco’s inventory is replenished on a near-monthly basis to meet continuous customer demand.

## INTRODUCTION

This report aims to evaluate Costco Wholesale Corporation's financial performance over the past decade, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess the company's financial health, profitability, growth, and operational efficiency. The analysis will identify trends in Costco’s financial performance by examining metrics such as revenue growth, profit margins, return on equity, and other relevant KPIs. The goal is to provide stakeholders with valuable insights that inform strategic decision-making regarding Costco’s market position, operational management, and potential for long-term shareholder value.

The KPIs selected for this analysis are: Operating Margin, Net Profit Margin, Debt-to-Equity Ratio, Inventory Turnover Ratio, and Net Income. Each of these metrics offers a unique perspective on Costco's operational performance and financial stability:

Operating Margin reflects Costco’s ability to generate profit from its core operations.
Net Profit Margin measures profitability after all expenses are accounted for.
Debt-to-Equity Ratio assesses the company's reliance on debt versus equity for financing.
Inventory Turnover Ratio indicates how efficiently Costco manages its inventory.
Net Income highlights the company’s overall profitability.

## METHODOLOGY

Data for this analysis was sourced from Costco’s annual 10-K reports, covering the period from 2014 to 2024. The selected KPIs—Operating Margin, Net Profit Margin, Debt-to-Equity Ratio, Inventory Turnover, and Net Income—were calculated using the following formulas:


Operating Margin = (Operating Income/Revenue)*100

Net Profit Margin = (Net Income/Revenue)*100

Debt-To-Equity = (Total Debt/Total Equity)

Inventory Turnover = (COGS/Average Inventory)

Net Income = Total Revenue - Total Expenses

Data extracted from each year’s 10-K report included Operating Income, Net Income, Revenue, Total Liabilities, Shareholder Equity, Inventory, Merchandise Cost, and Total Expenses.

## DETAILED ANALYSIS OF KPIs

#### Operating Margin
Operating margin measures a company's ability to generate profit from its core operations after covering fixed costs. Over the past decade, Costco has increased its operating margin by 30%, reaching 3.7% in 2024. In comparison to the grocery store industry average of 1% to 3%, Costco’s performance is notably strong, highlighting its operational efficiency.

#### Debt-to-Equity Ratio
The debt-to-equity ratio provides insight into a company’s financial leverage and risk. Costco’s D/E ratio has remained relatively stable over the past ten years, fluctuating between 1.6 and 2.3, with an average of 2.0. This means that for every dollar of equity, Costco carries approximately two dollars of debt. Although this is above the industry average of 1.5, it does not appear to negatively affect the company's profitability or financial stability. Despite frequent expansion, Costco has effectively managed its debt obligations, demonstrating resilience in leveraging debt to fuel growth.

#### Inventory Turnover Ratio
Inventory turnover indicates how efficiently a company manages and replenishes its inventory. Over the last decade, Costco has increased its inventory turnover ratio by 3.84%, with a current turnover of 12.05 times per year (2024). This means Costco's inventory is replenished roughly once a month. The industry standard for inventory turnover is typically between 10 and 15 times per year, placing Costco comfortably within this range, showcasing its efficient inventory management and ability to meet customer demand.

#### Net Income
Net income measures a company's total earnings after taxes and expenses. Over the past ten years, Costco’s net income has surged by 258%, from $2.06 billion in 2014 to $7.37 billion in 2024. Prior to 2020, Costco experienced steady, incremental growth, averaging a $500 million increase annually. Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, net income saw a significant uptick, particularly in 2021, due to higher grocery prices and inflationary pressures. This growth reflects Costco's ability to adapt to external challenges and capitalize on favorable market conditions.

#### Net Profit Margin
Net Profit Margin (NPM) is an important indicator of a company’s overall financial health and profitability. Over the past decade, Costco’s NPM has grown from 1.0% in 2014 to 3.5% in 2024, representing an increase of 1.95%. This steady improvement signals Costco’s enhanced profitability, indicating efficient cost management and effective revenue generation.
